# Data Scientist / Data Analyst Portfolio
---

Hello! My name is Semyon Grigor'ev, and i am a Data Scientist.

Starting from the begining, i transitioned to data analytics from the field of logistics, so i underwent professional retraining. In a short period, i achieved excellent results in the Netology course "Data Analyst from Scratch to Middle," where i received a diploma with the highest grade. After completing the course, i secured a fantastic position as a Data Analyst at the enterprise of PJSC "TOAZ." Here, i had to build the atmosphere and infrastructure for my work from scratch, as such a position did not exist in this place before. In my new role, i demonstrated outstanding results and showcased my abilities not only as a Data Analyst but also as a proficient Data Scientist. As i continued working, i honed my skills in Data Science and decided to fully embrace this direction, as it turned out to be more interesting than anything i had done before.

This repository contains projects i have completed, demonstrating my competencies in the field of Data Science and Data Analysis. Currently, these are primarily final projects completed independently during the Netology course and verified by experts. Additionally, there are test assignments from various companies and tasks that i was able to solve as i explored the field of Data Science. In the future, i plan to actively expand my portfolio with personal projects.

*Total number of projects in the repository:* **9**

### My Data Science / Data Analysis Projects
---

### [Unsupervised Sentiment Analisys of Smartphone Reviews (NLP)](https://github.com/Nevers15/NLP_Sent) 

The main goal of the project was to classify comments under smartphone models from an online store as negative or positive. To achieve this, a pre-trained algorithm was used, which multiplied the sentiment score by the corresponding cluster value and then by the TF-IDF value. The algorithm worked with unlabeled data, leading to some errors in its evaluation. However, the analysis revealed that the algorithm's performance is highly dependent on the language being analyzed.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Spacy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn, Word2Vec

**Industry:** Business, Marketing.

**Field of Expertise:** Data Science.

### [Implementation of the Exponential Family with Examples](https://github.com/Nevers15/Exp_fam/tree/main) 

The Exponential Family has many practical applications in statistics and machine learning. It is a unified family of distributions that contains most of the standard discrete and continuous distributions used for practical modeling. In my project, I am studying the Exponential Family on practical examples where I try to consider a unique case in which this distribution is used. In my examples, I used the following distributions: Poisson Distribution, Exponential Distribution, Gamma Distribution, Beta Distribution, Geometric Distribution.

**Tools:** Python, Scipy.stats, Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot

**Industry:** Machine Learning, Statistics.

**Field of Expertise:** Data Science, Data Analisys.
