### [Hacathon1: Development of a model for finding correlations in data](https://github.com/Nevers15/hacathon1) 

This was my first participation in a hackathon, in which we built a beautiful algorithm for finding anomalies and the metrics correlated with these anomalies. The algorithm takes a raw dataset as input, and the operator receives a table as output with time intervals and corresponding metrics that they should pay attention to. The algorithm allowed my team, consisting of two people including myself, to take the third place prize.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib.pyplot

**Industry:** Telemetry, Traffic.

**Field of Expertise:** Data Science.

### ["TOAZ" Payroll Fund Timeseries Forecasting Using SARIMA](https://github.com/Nevers15/ARIMA/tree/main) 

For this project, I collected and anonymized payroll data from the "TOAZ" company, where I was employed at the time of working on the project. The main idea was to develop an algorithm to predict changes in the payroll fund for the entire year of 2024. As a result, the model performs very well and accurately predicts four months ahead.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Statsmodels, Pmdarima, Dateutil, Matplotlib.pyplot

**Industry:** Business, Marketing.

**Field of Expertise:** Data Science.

### [Unsupervised Sentiment Analisys of Smartphone Reviews (NLP)](https://github.com/Nevers15/NLP_Sent) 

The main goal of the project was to classify comments under smartphone models from an online store as negative or positive. To achieve this, unsupervised algorithm was used, which multiplied the sentiment score of each word by the corresponding cluster value and then by the TF-IDF value of each word. The algorithm worked with unlabeled data, leading to some errors in its evaluation. However, the analysis revealed that the algorithm's performance is highly dependent on the language being analyzed.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Spacy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Sklearn, Gensim.Word2Vec

**Industry:** Business, Marketing.

**Field of Expertise:** Data Science.

### [Implementation of the Exponential Family with Examples](https://github.com/Nevers15/Exp_fam/tree/main) 

The Exponential Family has many practical applications in statistics and machine learning. It is a unified family of distributions that contains most of the standard discrete and continuous distributions used for practical modeling. In my project, I am studying the Exponential Family on practical examples where I try to consider a unique case in which this distribution is used. In my examples, I used the following distributions: Poisson Distribution, Exponential Distribution, Gamma Distribution, Beta Distribution, Geometric Distribution.

**Tools:** Python, Scipy.stats, Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot

**Industry:** Machine Learning, Statistics.

**Field of Expertise:** Data Science, Data Analisys.
